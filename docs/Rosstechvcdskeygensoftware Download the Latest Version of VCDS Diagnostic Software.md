You can check the serial number of the interface on the Ross-Tech website to verify its authenticity. If you buy an interface from a third-party vendor, you will also have to activate it with Ross-Tech before you can use it with VCDS. To activate your interface, you will have to provide the serial number of your interface and pay a fee to Ross-Tech. The fee varies depending on the type of interface and the number of cars you want to use it with. After you pay the fee, Ross-Tech will send you an activation code that you will have to enter in VCDS to unlock its full functionality. By activating your interface with Ross-Tech, you will get a genuine VCDS license and interface that are compatible with any car that VCDS supports.

Dororo (2007) is not a typical samurai movie, as it blends elements of fantasy, horror, comedy, and drama. The film is based on a classic manga and anime series by Osamu Tezuka, who is widely regarded as the godfather of Japanese comics and animation. The film pays homage to Tezuka's style and vision, while also updating the story for modern audiences.
 
The film's main strength is its dynamic duo of Hyakkimaru and Dororo, who are both complex and likable characters. Hyakkimaru is a tragic hero who struggles with his identity and humanity, while Dororo is a spunky sidekick who provides comic relief and emotional support. The actors who play them, Satoshi Tsumabuki and Ko Shibasaki, have great chemistry and charisma on screen. They also perform impressive stunts and sword fights, which are enhanced by the film's choreography and cinematography.
 
The film's main weakness is its inconsistent tone and quality. The film sometimes shifts from serious to silly, from scary to funny, without much coherence or transition. The film also suffers from some poor CGI effects, which can be distracting and unconvincing. The film's plot is also rather thin and predictable, with some clichÃ©s and loopholes. The film's ending is especially disappointing, as it leaves many questions unanswered and sets up for sequels that never materialized.
